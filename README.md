# About MS
MS is a neurological disease that affects the Human nervous system. The mechanism and the cause of the disease is yet unknown.
This study we created an R Script that will perform genetic expression analysis and also Identify their Methylation Sites and Interfering RNAs ( gene expression  regulatory factors)

# The bioinformatic process

The script was simplified to be faster and easier to use. ( No coding skills needed)

# Final Script ( can be downloaded from the Script repertory)
